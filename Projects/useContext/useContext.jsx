// useContext is a hook that allows you to use the context of a component when you are not inside the component. An example is toggling a theme from a button that is not inside the component that is using the theme, such as a button toggling between light and dark mode.
// useContext helps you avoid prop drilling, which is passing props through components that don't need the props, just to get to the component that needs the props.
// Together with useReducer, useContext can be used to create a global state that can be accessed from anywhere in the app.
