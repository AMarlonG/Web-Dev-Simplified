Instructions

    Initialize a Vite app or use Create React App
    Remove all unnecessary code
    Import the CSS/JSON files into your App.jsx
    Create a UserCard function component that takes in name, phoneNumber, age, and address props and has the same HTML as the user.html file.
    Pass the user information into the UserCard component from the App.jsx file
    Try manually changing the data in the user.json file to test that everything is hooked up properly
    Repeat steps 4-6 but with a class component instead of a function component
